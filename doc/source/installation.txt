Installation
************

Pre-requisites
==============

To make use of helita **you need a Fortran compiler** (`GFortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ is recommended), because some modules are compiled from Fortran. In addition, before attempting to install helita you need the following:

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ (2.7.x, 3.4.x or later)
* `Astropy <http://astropy.org>`_
* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_

In addition, the following packages are also recommended to take advantage of all the features:

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_
* `netCDF4 <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_
* `Cython <http://www.cython.org>`_
* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_
* `beautifulsoup4 <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup>`_

Helita will install without the above packages, but functionality will be limited.

All of the above packages are available through `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/>`_, and that is the recommended way of setting up your Python distribution.

Cloning git repository
======================

The easiest way is to use git to clone the repository. To grab the latest version of helita and install it::

    git clone https://github.com/ITA-solar/helita.git
    cd helita
    python setup.py install


Non-root install
================

If you don't have write permission to your Python packages directory, use the following option with ``setup.py``::

    python setup.py install --user

This will install helita under your home directory (typically ``~/.local``).

Developer install
=================

If you want to install helita but also actively change the code or contribute to its development, it is recommended that you do a developer install instead::

    python setup.py develop

This will set up the package such as the source files used are from the git repository that you cloned (only a link to it is placed on the Python packages directory). Can also be combined with the `--user` flag for local installs::

    python setup.py develop --user

Installing with different C or Fortran compilers
================================================

The procedure above will compile the C and Fortran modules using the default gcc/gfortran compilers. It will fail if these are not available in the system. If you want to use a different compiler, please use `setup.py` with the  `--compiler=xxx` and/or `--fcompiler=yyy` options, where `xxx`, `yyy` are C and Fortran compiler families (names depend on system). To check which Fortran compilers are available in your system, you can run::

    python setup.py build --help-fcompiler

and to check which C compilers are available::

    python setup.py build --help-compiler
