# Helita

Helita is a Python library for solar physics focused on interfacing with code and projects from the [Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics](http://astro.uio.no) (ITA) and the [Rosseland Centre for Solar Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/rocs/) (RoCS) at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no). The name comes from Helios + ITA.

The library is a loose collection of different scripts and classes with varying degrees of portability and usefulness.
